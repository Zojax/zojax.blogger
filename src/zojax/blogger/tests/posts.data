It is linked to medsphere.org and exclusively available to LinkedIn members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1369507">http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1369507</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Introduction of the group on LinkedIn:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>OpenVista Health Information Technology (HIT) is a new group for professionals that promote OpenVista and VistA-based systems to build a network that connects people, opportunities and ideas. OpenVista is a complete electronic medical record (EMR) based on an open source business model and is freely available under the AGPL (Affero General Public License). VistA (Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture) has been developed for around four decades and is in use across 1,200 nation-wide hospitals and health care facilities within the US Department of Veteran Affairs. As an enhanced port of the sucessful VistA, OpenVista relies on the newest cross-platform technology and is available for Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOSX. The OpenVista community is backed up by a commercial vendor for enterprise solutions. Commercial solutions of OpenVista have been successfully deployed nation-wide at different non-VA hospitals. One of Medsphere's customers, Midland Memorial Hospital, was able to reach the second highest level of US EMR adaption (Stage 6) with competitive low resources, costs per bed and time. If you are a manager, clinician, engineer or researcher trying to find a better way to deal with health care IT, then this group is for you.</p></div><!-- [DocumentBodyEnd:f0cb552d-5cb0-486a-ad0c-ac67e0637cdc] -->

One of twenty employees is leaving her/his work place in hope that the problem she/he has will be resolved when she/he's back. 54% of the respondents are trying to solve the problem on their own which even worses the situation in most cases. 35% are not able to finish their work in time, because of those problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This reflects the situation I was confronted with at GP offices and small to middle size hospitals. Education costs and staff needs to be accompanied all the time. Larger facilities solve the problem by investing in in-house IT specialists. The costs for GPs, for instance, are too high in order to invest in satisfying education and maintenance, especially since budgets are covered in Germany nowadays to lower healthcare expenses. It's always a balancing act and bad experience and frustration leads to higher barriers for user acceptance and thus willingness toward change. I heard from so many physicians and nurses that they are not satisfied with Windows and products running on that platform, and some solutions especially in the domain of GPs and smaller hospitals are really bad from an engineering perspective. But the willingness to change is so low that they rather keep with frustration and disatisfaction than being open for a new approach.</p></div><!-- [DocumentBodyEnd:0f0c71fa-3854-458d-8971-25e5937718b5] -->

Another success story that proofs lower costs for installation and maintenance while keeping the benefits of an IT infrastructure for the organization. The artifacle (see below) points to an important hurdle that needs to be taken: user acceptance. Especially, non-IT professionals are going through an imprint phase like a newborn that learns to deal with the world. Their first contact with a workstation, their first OS will permanently imprint on their minds. Demands towards Change Management are high. The use of open standards, the continuing development and improvement of vendor independent interfaces improve transparency, security and reliability of system integration. When is health care ready for the migration to the open source desktop?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="jive-quote"><span id="parent-fieldname-description"><strong>Open Source desktops are far cheaper to maintain than proprietary desktop configurations, says Rolf Schuster, a diplomat at the German Embassy in Madrid and the former head of IT at the Foreign Ministry.</strong></span> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Schuster was one of the participants in a discussion on Open Standards and interoperability that took place last week Tuesday during the Open Source World conference in the city of Malaga, Spain. The Foreign Ministry is migrating all of its 11.000 desktops to GNU/Linux and other Open source applications. According to Schuster, this has drastically reduced maintenance costs in comparison with other ministries. "The Foreign Ministry is running desktops in many far away and some very difficult locations. Yet we spend only one thousand euro per desktop per year. That is far lower than other ministries, that on average spend more than 3000 euro per desktop per year."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The ministry has so far migrated almost four thousand of its desktops to GNU/Linux and expects to complete the move by the summer of 2009, Schuster said. About half of all the 230 embassies and consulates have now been switched over. "It is not without problems. It took a while to find a developer in Japan to help us with some font issues we had in Open Office."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The embassies in Japan and Korea have completely switched over, the embassy in Madrid has been exclusively using GNU/Linux since October last year", Schuster added, calling the migration a success.</p><p><strong> <br /></strong></p><p><strong>Hurdle</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Foreign Ministry in 2001 began migrating its back-end IT systems to Open Source in order to provide all embassies and consulates with Internet access and email. "Our strategy was to use as far as possible Open Standards and Open Source. Reduction of costs was the main reason for this decision." Upon completion of this project, the ministry decided in 2004 to also migrate the desktops.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest hurdle proved to be to convince the two hundred IT workers a the ministry. "Their issues were not technical. They just did not know anything about Linux and Open Source and we had to change their views. We took all of them on a crash course of using Linux servers and configuring Apache. There they discovered that it works."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Schuster added that his data should not be mistaken for so-called Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) numbers. "We do definitely have by far the lowest IT cost in federal ministries, and therefore I would claim that we have an unbeatable TCO, but one should not give figures about TCO without a clear definition what you mean by that and how you measure it.</p></div><p> <span>Source:  &nbsp; <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.osor.eu/news/de-foreign-ministry-cost-of-open-source-desktop-maintenance-is-by-far-the-lowest">http://www.osor.eu/news/de-foreign-ministry-cost-of-open-source-desktop-maintenance-is-by-far-the-lowes</a></span></p></div><!-- [DocumentBodyEnd:c4e4552c-3181-4645-a669-5927d182407a] -->

It covers two major fields, Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics. The domain of Bioinformatics tries to help understanding biological processes with use of informatics (Information and Computer Science) by mostly focussing on the molecular level. It is a very exciting topic, but less relevant in our case. Medical Informatics, or sometimes referred to as Health Informatics, needs more attention. It defines an interface between clinical care and informatics with the purpose of appliance orientation. Thus, Medical Informatics supports structure, process, result and presentation of health care by using formal methods and concepts of informatics and modern ICT. Its character of interdisciplinarity and appliance orientation leads to a broad range of application fields. The allover goal is to support patient care and help to analyze, simulate, engineer and operate medical devices and health care facilities with methods of IT.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/about/bioinformatics/NCICB/images/venn.gif"><img src="http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/about/bioinformatics/NCICB/images/venn.gif" /></a></p><p><span>Source: NIH / NCICB<br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Medical Informatics covers fields like Software Engineering, Biometrics, Medical Documentation and Statistics, Telemedicine, Biosignal Processing, Image Processing or Hospital Management.

RIM is the HL7 data model that defines how applications or databases have to be designed in order to integrate different wards, units and facilities through current and future HL7 protocols. Tolven provides a RIM implementation as database. The UI is data-driven and very database-like, of course. It might be comparable to SAP. The database scheme is XML driven. This is very interesting in context of CCR (Continuous Care Record) and CCD (Continues Care Document) support since both use XML too. The underlying technology stack is absolutely open source. Tolven Health Record is implemented in Java and uses JBoss as application server. An absolute Brownie point is that it relies on my favorite database PostgreSQL, a highly scalable object-relational DBMS. But, let's take a look how to install that beast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Required packages for installation:</p><ul><li type="ul"><p>Java 6</p></li><li type="ul"><p>OpenLDAP</p></li><li type="ul"><p>PostgreSQL</p></li></ul><!--[CodeBlockStart:fb0ee643-6fed-48ae-b408-97dd57a03ec9]--><pre class="jive-pre"><code class="jive-code">sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre slapd postgresql</code></pre><!--[CodeBlockEnd:fb0ee643-6fed-48ae-b408-97dd57a03ec9]--><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Download and run the Tolven installer.</p><!--[CodeBlockStart:e1a9338b-2eb8-43e5-a6d1-021b9c168b06]--><pre class="jive-pre"><code class="jive-code">wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/tolven/tolven-1.1.0.beta2a.jar?modtime=1205484660&amp;big_mirror=0\u000Asudo java -jar tolven-1.1.0.beta2a.jar</code></pre><!--[CodeBlockEnd:e1a9338b-2eb8-43e5-a6d1-021b9c168b06]--><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Switch to the installation folder and start the application server.</p><!--[CodeBlockStart:8ef57000-49ed-4225-9dcf-36e2e752c7d3]--><pre class="jive-pre"><code class="jive-code">sudo -s\u000Acd /usr/local/tolven-1.1.0.beta2a/bin\u000A./startTolvenJBoss.sh</code></pre><!--[CodeBlockEnd:8ef57000-49ed-4225-9dcf-36e2e752c7d3]--><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When JBoss is up and running, you should see following message.
